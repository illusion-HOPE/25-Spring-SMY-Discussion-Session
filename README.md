# 25-Spring-SMY-Discussion-Session
This is a Advanced Algebra II course website, specifically created for my dear friend smy, Spring 2025. 

We will first discuss univariate polynomial rings, then explore the canonical forms of similar matrices (notably the Jordan normal form over the complex field), as well as topics related to Euclidean spaces and quadratic forms.
