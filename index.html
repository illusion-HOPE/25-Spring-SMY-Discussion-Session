        <p>To you,</p>
        <p>Hello.</p>
        <p>I'm not sure if you will ever open this page again. Right now, as I'm writing this, it's 19:05 on March 17, 2025, the time when we should have been in our scheduled lecture.</p>
        <p>But not everything goes as expected. This outcome is not a coincidence, but a decision I've thought over carefully.</p>
        <p>We've known each other for almost nine months, and there were times when we had good moments. You might think I'm a good person, but I've never really felt that you treated me as a true friend. These past two weeks of silence have been difficult for I can't even count how many days I've longed for a message from you, not about studies, but about life.</p>
        <p>I am not a robot, nor an old cardigan you can discard whenever you like. I am a real person, longing for sincerity, care, and companionship. You can't deny that I've been slowly fading from your life while your time is now spent entirely with those you have classes with. I don't intend to stop you, nor do I want to. But the feeling of being ignored has hurt me deeply.</p>
        <p>I'm sorry if I have brought you pain or anger. But I truly hope you'll enjoy your life without me.</p>
        <p>Thank you for the days we spent together, but new days are coming. I wish you all the best.</p>
        <div class="signature">
            <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
            <p><strong>Maybe your last best friend,</strong></p>
            <p><em>Illusion</em></p>
            <p>March 17, 2025</p>
